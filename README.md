# Supervised Machine Learning & Credit Risk

## Overview of the Analysis

### To utilize oversampling algorithims (RandomOverSampler, SMOTE), undersampling algorithms (ClusterCentroids), combinational algorithms (SMOTEENN), and machine learning models (BalancedRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier); determining which presents the best predictive measures of credit risk. 

## Results

### As referneced above there were six algorithms used to predict credit risk, using a credit card dataset from LendingClub. The results of these algorithms are listed below:

### Balanced Accuracy Scores

| RandomOverSampler | SMOTE            | ClusterCentroids | SMOTEENN | BalancedRandomForestClassifier | EasyEnsembleClassifier |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 64% (~0.6403)     | 65% (~0.6515)     |                  |          |                                |                        |
